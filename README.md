A predictive model to potentially identify high-risk COVID-19 infected patients based on easily analysed CTSS scores. 
These findings can enable effective and efficient care programs for high-risk patients and periodic monitoring for the low-risk ones, thereby easing the hospital flow of patients and can further be utilized for hospital bed utilizationassessment.
The present Machine Learning based SVM (Support Vector Machine) model results in 98% of high accuracy on training, 97% of accuracy on testing and high precision
to classify the COVID-19 patients as high-risk patients needs hospitalization than lower risk patients.
